- v1.0.0
    - 1/3/2022, Updated DSYiM to version v51. DSYiM v51 has simpler "Y" (similar to `++`) 
        and text representation will be `>(++)<` or simply `(++)`. It is modified "Yo" 
        character to make it symmetry vertically and horizontally.
        - Also, PNG and ICO have been updated accordingly.
        - Added meta description tags.
- v1.0.7
    - 1/18/2022, Able to download DSYiM created in https://gonn.org/dsyim/ 
        eg. https://gonn.org/dsyim/#size=250&fill=red&stroke=white


## Todo

- [X] G100 -- Make it a structural outline -- instead of `section/h2` for title, 
    use `h1`, so it can be structured.
- [ ] G101 -- Except for the main entry point (/), separate CSS and SVG into separate
    files.
- [X] G102 -- Change the color on `/enc` page to have more contrast.
- [X] G103 -- Recreated DSYiM from the scratch. (1/4/2023, v52)
